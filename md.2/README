MD dynamics of spring chain with Verlet integrator

1.4) comparing of Verlet and Velocity Verlet algorithms
1.5) testing a different time unit (nanoseconds instead of picoseconds)
1.7) comparing the result of simulations after applying a perturbation to 1D chain
1.8) repeating 1.7 with 3D chain; estimating Lyapunov divergence parameters
